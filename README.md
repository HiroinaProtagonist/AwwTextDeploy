# AwwTextDeploy

AwwText is an application powered by the Twilio API and the Reddit API that allows users to input a phone number and send Reddit's /r/aww top post of the day to that number as an SMS/MMS message.

See [AwwText](https://awwtext.herokuapp.com/) (https://awwtext.herokuapp.com/) for the active app.
